# timemonkey-csharp
A simple application that watches the time spent on applications and websites on your desktop.

# Inpiration and Purpose
The inspiration for performing this software came from a number of other performance software that perform the same task, such as Rescue Time, Hubstaff, and TimeDoctor.

I always look for new projects to train my programming. As I work with C # again I will do it all in C #, though and use WinAPI with PInvoke.

The goal is to create a functional application, which performs a usage log on the software, windows and urls.

# OpenSource Codes
Several codes and have been taken from internet examples, github and stackoverflow responses, I will try to relate them all here.
